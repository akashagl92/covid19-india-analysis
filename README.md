# covid19-india-analysis

The dashboard on Covid19 Analysis, specific to India and Indian states, is built to allow better visual comprehension of progress and updates in COVID19 cases in each state which in turn allows for better comparison between the states. With the newly discovered [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/) library, this dashboard is completely built on Python.

The data source of the dashboard is as follows:

  Cases, Deaths and Recovered Data - (https://api.rootnet.in/covid19-in/stats/history)
  
  Tests Data - (https://api.rootnet.in/covid19-in/stats/testing/raw)
